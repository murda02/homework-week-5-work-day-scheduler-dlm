# Homework week 5 | Work Day Scheduler

This week I made a work day scheduler. The user can enter tasks, meetings, to-do's, etc. in the hourly time slots, hit the save button and the information entered will persist after the web page is reloaded.

## Features 

* The current date is displayed in the header of the web page
* The user can enter input to each timeslot and that information will persist even after the web page is reloaded
